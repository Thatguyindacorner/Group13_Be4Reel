# Group13_Be4Reel
Final project for Advanced iOS Development

A spin on the BeReel App but instead of a picture posted everyday, it's a quote.
Quotes can be randomly generated using an api or manually typed in.
Need to create an account and add friends to see what they posted (only if you also posted on the same day).
UI is a bit rudamentary due to time constraints.
